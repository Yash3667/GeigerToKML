- The color of each path is calculated depending on the average radiation level between points on the path (the minimum number of points on a path is 2, and consecutive points that have the same color are placed on a single path).
- Recommended milestones are:
	* Green should be trivial levels of radiation.
	* Yellow should be a level of radiation which indicates abnormal activity.
	* Orange should denote a level of radiation, which, if exposed to for an extended period of time, can cause significant health effects.
	* Red is the level of radiation which, if exposed to constantly for an extended period of time can cause VERY significant health effects, or if exposed to for a brief period of time can cause significant health effects.
	* Ranges above the aforementioned Red milestone are simply denoted as Red.
- Colors range from Green (very low radiation), to Yellow (noteworthy radiation), to Orange (medium radiation) to Red (dangerous radiation). Corresponding graphs are shown below.

- The milestones are tunable variables held in Mapper.py. Each milestone is calculated using two tunable constants: 
	* Dosage (milliSieverts): The dosage.
	* Period (hours): The time period over which the dosage is administered.
